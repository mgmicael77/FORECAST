#Retail Sales Forecasting Models


This repository contains four different models designed to forecast unit sales of a retail store while comparing the effects of concurrent promotions with interpretability. The benchmark model used is SARIMAX, and three other models - LSTM, XGBoost, and Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) - are also implemented for comparison purposes. The SHAP library is employed to interpret the results of each model.
